# Netflix Analysis

## Overview
This project, `netflix_analysis`, is a data analysis initiative focused on exploring and visualizing datasets related to Netflix content. It aims to uncover insights such as content trends, viewer preferences, and genre popularity using Python-based data analysis tools.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix_analysis.git
   cd netflix_analysis
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` file includes dependencies like:
   - pandas
   - numpy
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - jupyter

3. **Download the dataset**:
   Place the Netflix dataset (e.g., `netflix_titles.csv`) in the `data/` directory. You can source datasets from platforms like Kaggle or Netflix's open datasets.

## Usage
1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open `analysis.ipynb` to view the data cleaning, exploration, and visualization steps.

2. **Run scripts directly**:
   Alternatively, execute Python scripts for specific tasks:
   ```bash
   python scripts/clean_data.py
   python scripts/visualize.py
   ```

3. **Example outputs**:
   - Visualizations are saved in the `outputs/` directory as PNG files.
   - Processed datasets are stored in `data/processed/`.
